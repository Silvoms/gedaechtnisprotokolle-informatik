1\.       Answer some theoretical questions, some I can remember are:

a.       Why do we need to scale data when we work with LinearRegression

b.       What are 4 things you look at when preprocessing a dataset when having a classification problem

c.       Describe MICE imputing

d.       What are 2 benefits of Cross-Validation over Hold out split

2\.       Fuzzy logic, the formula of the center of gravity is given

3\.       True or False, explain why false

4\.       Linear regression, using Gradient Descent and the loss of Root mean square(formula given )

5\.       Decision Tree. A dataset is given and you have to create one tree, the formula of Gini impurity is given. Also as a subquestion, giving new data what is the prediction what is the output

6\.       A question regarding machine learning workflow. A task is given (specific task, but I don’t remember) and you have to draw the workflow, how would you preprocess data, collect features, and train and evaluate model
